# CryptomattePRO
Custom MRQ setting for rendering Cryptomatte passes in UE5

The content on the repository is just duplicated folder structure of a newly created custom plugin in Unreal Engine 5.0.3 

In case the compiler gives **error** when trying to add this to your project keep in mind it should be placed in a 'Plugins' folder in the project folder. 

The plugin is dependent on the MRQ library so make sure it is enabled in your project before you add this plugin.
